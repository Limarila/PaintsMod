##This mod includes:
Colored planks for each dye-color. They are crafted the same way as terra cotta, as in 8 planks around 1 dye gives 8 colored planks.

Happy building everyone<3

###Future updates will include:
* New textures (as I'm only semi happy with how these turned out)
* Colored versions of each plank-type e.g. Pink Dark Oak Planks will be much darker than the Pink Birch Planks

This is my very first mod, so I would very much appreciate any relevant advice given with good intentions, as I am still learning.
